      <p class="bio">
        Born &amp; raised in Ann Arbor, MI, I started voice &amp; piano at 3 and
        drums at 10. After singing in Operettas, playing drums in musicals and a
        Beatles Tribute band, I was fortunate enough to play hundreds of gigs in
        the Community High School Jazz Band, led by band director, mentor and
        multi-instrumentalist, Mike Grace. My main High School original rock
        band, Rain, had many influences including Zeppelin, Hendrix and Joe
        Walsh. I played in a number of cover bands as well playing anything from
        pop & classic rock to metal. After graduation, the CHS Jazz band toured
        Europe and played at the North Sea Jazz Festival with Miles Davis and
        Herbie Hancock. In the 90s, I moved to Boston to go to Berklee College
        of Music for 2 yrs where I studied with Rick Consadine (Rick's Licks!)
        and took classes with Larry Finn and Skip Hadden with a Dual major in
        Performance & Jazz Composition. Then started working in cover bands,
        original bands and playing on a lot of records thanks to Richard Marr,
        the guitarist from my favorite old band, Flexie. In 2003 I moved to L.A.
        Played in many bands including, Silver Needle, Chemical Burn and my
        current band When In Rome II with founding member Michael Floreale for
        the past 7 years and another local band called Aurora Sect, created by
        frontman Daniel Tatomer, formerly of Silver Needle. I also toured with
        Boston band, The Charms (lead by Ellie Vee), who had much acclaim on
        Little Stevens Underground Garage and his label as well as a track on
        the Christmas with The Kranks soundtrack. Over the years, I've studied
        with Dave Weckl, Steve Ferrone, Joey Heredia, Dave Elitch, Jason Sutter
        and had many long talks with the late, great Freddie Gruber: the
        Godfather of Drumming, whose students included Buddy Rich and Neil
        Peart. Thanks to Brian Ray and my first L.A. teaching client, Elizabeth
        Weinstock, I also had over 10 drum students primarily between the years
        of 2007 to 2013. Currently, I'm preparing to go back into the studio
        with Aurora Sect and shedding as much as possible. Soon, I will be
        avaiable for Zoom lessons. You can contact me on Social Media. Add me
        and message me and I'll send you my text info. Once I update the site
        with a contact page, you can contact me here.
